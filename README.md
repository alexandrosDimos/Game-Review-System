# game-review-system
This application was developed for a course project. We wanted to create a game review application much like gamespot or metacritic. Although we never deployed our project online, it covers all the basic aspects such an application should have:
- A login-register form.
- All available gaming platforms.
- A simple GUI interface to add new games to the database. 
- Games have multiple features like release date, genre, publisher etc.
- A rating system.
- A simple comment section for each game page.
- A menu with many filters to choose from and narrow down the games you wish to view.
# Appart from the code files, we also uploaded our database, which was developed in MySQL Workbench.
